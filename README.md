**Music Genre Prediction using Logistic Regression**

This project uses logistic regression to predict music preferences based on user characteristics.

**Overview**

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is preformatted for training.

A logistic regression model was trained to predict the target label (e.g., whether a song will be popular).

The project was initially based on a linear model and later updated to use logistic regression for classification.
