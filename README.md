Music Genre Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project uses logistic regression to predict music preferences based on user characteristics.

Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is preformatted for training.

A logistic regression model was trained to predict the target label (e.g., whether a user likes a certain type of music).

The project was initially based on a linear model and later updated to use logistic regression for classification.

Steps
Load and preprocess the dataset (cleaning, splitting, normalization).

Train a logistic regression model on the training set.

Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.

Display prediction results using simple metrics and plots.
